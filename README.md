# cl-boozer
A script in Common Lisp to spec out booze in terms of dollars per ml of pure alcohol

## Why?

My friends and I were sitting around half corked after the Raptors soundly kicked some Warriors butt, and got to wondering what was the cheapest booze we had. Ends up, simply guessing is harder than you'd expect. Is it cheaper to get drunk on a 3/4 litre bottle of whisky or a fridge full of tall boys of strong Polish beer? How about that enticing bottle of fine Ontario cab-sauv?

In the spirit of competition, this is how I decided to find out.

Anyway, this turned out kinda neat and vaguely useful, so maybe I'll turn this into something a little more polished and feature-ful. Feel free to push some code my way if you like the idea.

## What?

Right now, all it does is ask you for the size of the bottle, the price of the bottle, how much alcohol (in abv) is in the bottle, and what the bottle return is. Where I'm from, beer and small containers are 10c while wine and other larger format bottles are 20c.

## License

It's public domain. I mean, its only practical (?) use would be to help you get drunk for the cheapest price possible. So drink a toast for me if you find this at all useful.

## And....?

Oh yea... ends up, Apera is by far the cheapest swill we had, at a whopping 6 cents per ml of alcohol. Wanna get smashed, that's how you do it!

```
Enter bottle size in mL: 750
Enter price in dollars: 9.20
Enter abv: 20
Enter bottle return in cents: 20
That's $0.060 per mL of pure alcohol.
```

Experimenting with different values, I compared the price of a 6 pack of No Name beer (which was supposedly one of the first versions "buck a beer" that our loser premier Doug Ford tried to foist on us). Here's the result:

```
Enter bottle size in mL: 2046
Enter price in dollars: 10.45
Enter abv: 5
Enter bottle return in cents: 10
That's $0.101 per mL of pure alcohol.
```

Here is the result for a can of Tatra:

```
Enter bottle size in mL: 500
Enter price in dollars: 2.10
Enter abv: 5.5
Enter bottle return in cents: 10
That's $0.073 per mL of pure alcohol.
```

Ever get the feeling your boozy Premier doesn't know wtf he's talking about? Ends up pretty much all the Euro beers are cheaper than his first example of buck-a-beer-that-wasn't. And it's not even a buck a beer. Hell, he came up with that idea when $1.35 beer was legal, and that wasn't available anywhere either. Can't wait til we can vote his stupid ass out.
